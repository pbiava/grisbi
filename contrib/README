This contrib directory contains various things that can be useful for
Grisbi users:

 - obfuscate.pl : a Perl script that creates an anonymize Grisbi file,
   suitable to attach in a bug report without discarding personal
   information like name, address, balances, ...

 - plan-comptable.cgsb : a Grisbi categories file to import, which
   contains the French "Plan comptable général".  Thanks Jean-Michel.
